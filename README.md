#### Context
High-quality financial data is expensive to acquire and is therefore rarely shared for free. Here I provide the full historical daily price and volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT. It's one of the best datasets of its kind you can obtain.

#### Content
The data (last updated 11/10/2017) is presented in CSV format as follows: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt. Note that prices have been adjusted for dividends and splits.

#### Inspiration
Many have tried, but most have failed, to predict the stock market's ups and downs. Can you do any better?
